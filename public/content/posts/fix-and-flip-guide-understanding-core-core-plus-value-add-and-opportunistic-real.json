      "text": "Core properties are in great locations, already in good condition, and attract reliable tenants or buyers. These deals involve minimal renovation—think cosmetic updates—and are typically financed with less than 50% debt. For fix-and-flip, core investments offer the lowest risk but also the lowest returns, usually in the 7-10% range. They’re ideal if you want a quick, low-effort flip or are just starting out."

Success depends on your renovation skills, local market knowledge, and project management."
