      "text": "Diversifying your capital across different asset types is essential for managing risk, especially in the fix-and-flip business. If one project underperforms, gains from other investments—such as rentals, stocks, or bonds—can help offset losses. Strategic asset allocation is a long-term approach that lets you set your investment mix up front, then rebalance periodically, so you can focus on finding and renovating properties instead of constantly tweaking your portfolio."
