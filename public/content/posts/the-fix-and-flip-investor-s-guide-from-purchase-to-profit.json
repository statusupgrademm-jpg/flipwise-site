        "Define Your Investment Goals and Budget: Decide if your flip will target first-time buyers, rental investors, or luxury buyers. Set your max purchase and renovation budget, and build in a buffer for surprises.",
        "Secure Financing: Explore hard money loans, private lenders, or lines of credit. Make sure you understand loan terms, interest rates, and required reserves.",
        "Choose the Right Property and Location: Look for undervalued homes in high-demand neighborhoods. Check zoning, school districts, utility access, and resale or rental demand.",
        "Build Your Team: Hire a reliable general contractor, architect (if needed), inspectors, and real estate agent. Make sure everyone is licensed, insured, and experienced with flips.",
        "Design Your Renovation: Focus on improvements that maximize ROI—kitchens, bathrooms, curb appeal, and energy efficiency. Balance style with budget and timeline.",
        "Get Permits and Insurance: Ensure all work is permitted and covered by insurance to avoid costly delays or legal issues.",
        "Prepare the Site: Demo what’s needed, clear debris, and address any foundational or utility issues before starting renovations.",
        "Renovate: Oversee construction from framing to finishes. Schedule regular site visits and keep in close contact with your GC to stay on track.",
        "Final Inspections and Punch List: Pass all required inspections, walk the property, and create a punch list of final touch-ups before listing.",
        "List, Sell, and Maintain: Stage the property, list with a knowledgeable agent, and keep up with maintenance until closing. Track your expenses and returns for future projects."
