        "Secure financing: Explore hard money loans, private lenders, or lines of credit. Factor in loan interest, closing costs, and reserves for unexpected expenses.",
        "Choose the right property and location: Look for undervalued homes in high-demand neighborhoods. Consider zoning, school districts, access to utilities, local amenities, and future resale value.",
        "Assemble your fix-and-flip team: Hire an experienced general contractor, architect (for major changes), inspectors, and real estate agent. Ensure everyone is licensed and insured.",
        "Design your renovation: Focus on updates that maximize ROI—kitchens, bathrooms, curb appeal, and energy efficiency. Balance cost, timeline, and buyer appeal.",
        "Secure permits and insurance: Work with your GC to handle permits and inspections. Make sure you have builder’s risk insurance and liability coverage.",
        "Prepare the site: Clear out debris, demo unwanted features, and address foundational issues. Ensure utilities are ready for renovation work.",
        "Renovate the property: Oversee framing, mechanicals, drywall, finishes, and landscaping. Conduct regular walkthroughs to keep the project on track.",
        "Final inspections and punch list: Schedule final city inspections and create a punch list of outstanding items. Ensure all work meets code and contract requirements.",
        "List, sell, and maintain: Stage the property, market aggressively, and work with your agent to sell quickly. Register warranties and set up post-sale maintenance if needed."
