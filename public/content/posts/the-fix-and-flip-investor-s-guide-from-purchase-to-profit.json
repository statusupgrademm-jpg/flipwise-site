        "Secure Permits and Insurance: Obtain all necessary permits for major work and ensure you have builder’s risk or renovation insurance in place.",
        "Prepare the Site: Demo outdated features, clear debris, and address any foundational or structural issues before cosmetic upgrades.",
        "Renovate the Property: Oversee the rehab process, focusing on high-ROI improvements. Keep the project on schedule and budget with regular check-ins and milestone walkthroughs.",
        "Final Inspections and Punch List: Schedule municipal inspections as required. Complete a thorough walk-through to address any outstanding issues before listing.",
        "Sell or Rent for Profit: Stage the property, market aggressively, and work with your agent to price competitively. Track final costs and returns to inform your next investment."
