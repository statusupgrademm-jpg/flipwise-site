        "Licensing: Verify the GC holds a valid state contractor’s license with no violations. Use your state’s licensing board to confirm.",
        "Insurance: Require proof of liability and workers’ comp insurance. Confirm coverage is active and covers all workers, including subcontractors.",
        "Experience: Look for at least 5 years of local experience with projects similar to your flip. Check online reviews, references, and complaint history.",
        "Crew Oversight: Understand if the GC uses in-house crews, subcontractors, or both. Ensure all are insured and that a qualified supervisor is on-site regularly.",
        "Permits & Approvals: The GC should handle all city permits, inspections, and secure the Certificate of Occupancy (CoFO) at completion. Expect regular progress updates.",
        "Payment Schedule: Never pay in full up front. Payments should be milestone-based, with the final payment due only after satisfactory completion. Ensure upfront fees comply with state law.",
        "Detailed Contract: Insist on a clear, itemized contract covering costs, timeline, payment milestones, change orders, insurance, permits, project management, warranty, and a completion guarantee."
