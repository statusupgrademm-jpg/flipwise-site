        "Insurance: Require proof of liability and workers’ comp insurance. Verify policies are active with the provider.",
        "Experience: Look for at least five years in your market and a track record with similar rehab or flip projects. Review online ratings and check for unresolved complaints.",
        "Crew Oversight: Ask if work is done by in-house staff or subcontractors and ensure all are covered by workers’ comp. Confirm who will supervise the project day-to-day.",
        "Permits & Approvals: Ensure the GC will handle all city permits, code compliance, and secure the Certificate of Occupancy (CoFO). Expect regular progress updates.",
        "Payment Schedule: Never pay in full upfront. Use milestone-based payments and withhold final payment until the project is complete and passes inspection.",
        "Contract Terms: Insist on a detailed, signed contract covering itemized costs, timelines, payment milestones, insurance, permits, change orders, and warranties. Make sure the contract is clear and legally compliant."
