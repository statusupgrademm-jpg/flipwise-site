      "text": "Syndication pools money from multiple investors to fund a real estate project, such as a fix-and-flip. A professional sponsor manages everything: acquisition, renovation, and sale. Investors provide capital and receive a share of the profits, but have no hands-on role."

        "Upfront Costs: Syndication lets you invest with as little as $10k-$25k; direct ownership requires the full down payment, closing costs, and renovation budget.",
        "Ongoing Expenses: Syndication is hands-off after your initial investment. Direct ownership means you cover all holding costs, repairs, and surprises.",
        "Time & Energy: Syndication is passive. Direct ownership demands your time for project management, hiring, and problem-solving.",
        "Skills Needed: Syndication leverages the sponsor’s expertise. Direct ownership requires you to know the fix-and-flip process or hire trusted help.",
        "Diversification: Lower minimums in syndication make it easier to spread your money across multiple flips. Direct ownership ties up more capital in each deal.",
        "Barriers to Entry: Syndication usually requires you to be an accredited investor. Direct ownership is open to anyone with enough cash and credit.",
        "Liquidity: Syndication projects often have a set timeline (sometimes under 2 years). Direct ownership can be less liquid if a property takes longer to sell.",
        "Risk: Syndication spreads risk among many investors and relies on experienced managers. Direct ownership puts all the risk (and reward) on you.",
        "Control: Direct ownership gives you full control over every decision. Syndication means you trust the sponsor’s plan and execution.",
        "Property Access: Only direct owners can access, improve, or occupy the property. Syndication investors cannot."

If you prefer passive investing, lower minimums, and leveraging expert teams, syndication can let you profit from flips without the day-to-day grind."
