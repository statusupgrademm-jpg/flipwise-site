Stocks are easy to buy and sell, require little day-to-day involvement, and can be started with a small amount of cash. In contrast, fix-and-flip projects are hands-on, require significant upfront capital, but offer more control and the potential for forced appreciation through renovations."

However, successful fix-and-flip projects can generate much higher returns in a short timeframe, especially when you add value through renovations. The risk is higher, but so is the potential reward if you have the right strategy and local market knowledge."
