      "text": "The BRRRR method is a real estate investment strategy designed to help you build a portfolio with minimal capital tied up in each deal. Unlike fix-and-flip, where you sell the property after renovation, BRRRR focuses on long-term rental income and equity growth. The process involves five steps: Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, and Repeat."

        "Buy: Target distressed or undervalued properties, much like a fix-and-flip. Aim to keep your purchase price plus renovation costs below 75% of the after-repair value (ARV).",
        "Rehab: Renovate the property for maximum ROI. Focus on improvements that boost value and appeal to renters—think kitchens, bathrooms, paint, and curb appeal.",
        "Rent: Fill the property with qualified tenants. Strong rental income can help increase appraised value and make refinancing easier.",
        "Refinance: Once the property is stabilized with tenants, refinance based on the new, higher value. Ideally, you pull out most or all of your original investment—similar to getting your flip profits, but you keep the property.",
        "Repeat: Use the cash from your refinance to buy your next property and repeat the process."

After renovation and leasing, you refinance at 75% ARV ($637,500), pay off your original loan, and pocket $117,500—enough to fund your next deal, just like flipping, but you keep the asset."
