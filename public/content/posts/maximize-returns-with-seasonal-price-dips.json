        "Seasonal Slowdown in Demand: Many buyers, especially families with school-aged children, prefer to move during summer, leading to less competition in the fall and winter.",
        "Weather and Curb Appeal Challenges: Cold, rain, and shorter days can make properties less appealing and discourage buyers from house hunting.",
        "Market Psychology: Cultural expectations reinforce the idea that spring and summer are better times to buy or sell, reducing activity and prices in the off-season.",
        "Inventory Mix Changes: Sellers in the fall and winter are often more motivated, increasing the likelihood of accepting lower offers.",
        "Appraisal and Pricing Patterns: Lower sales in the slow season can impact appraisals, further reinforcing the seasonal price dip."

      "text": "Investors can take advantage of temporary price declines by purchasing properties in the fall and winter. Buying during these periods can improve rental yield and potential resale profits as values rise in peak seasons. In markets with property tax caps, acquiring property at a lower price can also reduce long-term tax liabilities."
