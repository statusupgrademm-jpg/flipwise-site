        "Cryptocurrencies: Digital assets like Bitcoin can skyrocket—or crash—overnight. Volatility is extreme, and the market is unpredictable.",
        "Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs): Early-stage crypto projects where you buy tokens before launch. Huge upside if the project takes off, but many fail.",
        "Penny Stocks: Shares under $5, often in small companies. Big swings are possible, but so is total loss due to low liquidity and lack of info.",
        "Venture Capital: Investing in startups with high growth potential. If you pick a winner, returns can be massive, but most startups fail.",
        "Angel Investing: Similar to VC, but usually smaller checks at an earlier stage. High risk, but early entry means high reward if successful.",
        "Leveraged ETFs: Funds that use debt and derivatives to multiply gains (and losses). Not for the faint of heart—meant for short-term plays.",
        "Wholesaling: Make an offer on a property, then sell the contract for a profit. Quick returns are possible, but you’re on the hook if you can’t find a buyer."
