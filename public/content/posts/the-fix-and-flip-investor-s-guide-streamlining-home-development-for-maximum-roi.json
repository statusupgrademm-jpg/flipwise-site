        "Define Your Exit Strategy and Budget: Decide if you’ll flip for a quick sale or hold as a rental. Set a strict budget, including purchase, rehab, holding, and selling costs. Build in a buffer for unexpected expenses.",
        "Secure Financing: Line up hard money loans, private lenders, or construction loans. Ensure you have enough capital for acquisition, rehab, and carrying costs. Factor in interest, closing fees, and contingency reserves.",
        "Choose the Right Property and Location: Target undervalued homes in high-demand neighborhoods. Check zoning, school districts, access to utilities, and neighborhood comps. Look for properties with strong resale or rental potential.",
        "Build Your Team: Hire an experienced general contractor, architect (if needed), and reliable subcontractors. Consider working with a real estate agent who knows the local market. Vet all professionals for licenses, insurance, and references.",
        "Design for Value: Focus on layouts and finishes that appeal to local buyers or renters. Prioritize upgrades with the highest ROI—kitchens, baths, flooring, and curb appeal. Consider energy efficiency and low-maintenance materials.",
        "Handle Permits and Insurance: Pull all required permits to avoid costly delays or fines. Make sure you have builder’s risk and liability insurance in place before work begins.",
        "Prep the Site: Demo existing structures if needed. Clear, grade, and address foundational issues. Ensure utilities are ready for inspection and future buyers.",
        "Manage the Rehab: Oversee each phase—framing, systems (plumbing, electrical, HVAC), insulation, drywall, finishes. Hold regular site visits and meetings to keep the project on schedule and within budget.",
        "Final Inspections and Punch List: Schedule municipal inspections for code compliance. Walk the property with your contractor to create a punch list of final tasks. Collect warranties and lien releases.",
        "Market and Sell (or Rent): Stage the property for maximum appeal. List with a knowledgeable agent or property manager. Track all expenses and returns to evaluate your project’s success."
