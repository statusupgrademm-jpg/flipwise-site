        "What is your plan for the property? Define your intended use—such as agriculture, development, or holding for resale—and consider factors like subdividing, development feasibility, and your exit strategy.",
        "Does the zoning match your plan? Confirm that local zoning laws align with your intended use. Changing zoning can be time-consuming and uncertain, so have a backup plan if needed.",
        "Will the soil support your intended use? Test soil quality and check for environmental restrictions, as both can impact agricultural or development potential.",
        "How accessible is the property? Evaluate road access, proximity to services, and any easements that may affect value or usability.",
        "Are utilities available? Assess the availability and cost of bringing water, electricity, gas, and sewage to the site, as this can significantly affect your budget and timeline.",
        "How will you finance the property? Understand that raw land loans often require higher down payments and interest rates. Factor in holding costs like taxes and insurance.",
        "Is this the best use of your investment funds? Compare projected returns from raw land to other opportunities, and honestly assess your expertise and resources for maximizing value."
