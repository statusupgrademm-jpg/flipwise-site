        "Negotiating Power: Motivated sellers, especially those facing foreclosure, are often willing to negotiate on price, terms, or even include personal property.",
        "Buying at a Discount: Distressed homes are typically priced below market value, giving you a better margin for your flip—even after renovation costs.",
        "Forced Appreciation: Renovations can quickly boost property value, allowing you to sell for a profit in a short timeframe.",
        "Potential for Ongoing Income: If you decide to hold instead of sell, renting out the renovated property can provide steady cash flow and tax benefits."

        "High Renovation Costs: Budgets can easily be blown by unexpected repairs, material overruns, or labor delays.",
        "Building Permit Issues: Extensive renovations often require permits. Delays or misunderstandings can stall your project and increase costs.",
