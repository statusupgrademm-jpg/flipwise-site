        "Buying at a Discount: With fewer buyers and motivated sellers, you can often secure properties below market value—even after renovation costs, there’s room for profit.",
        "Forced Appreciation: Renovate and add value fast, then sell at a higher price in a short time frame.",
        "Potential for Ongoing Income: Hold and rent the renovated property for steady cash flow and tax benefits."

        "Permit Problems: Major renovations often require permits. Delays or misunderstandings can stall your project and increase holding costs.",
