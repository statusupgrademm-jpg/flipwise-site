Instead of owning the property in your own name, you create a business entity to hold title. This approach offers several advantages, but also comes with some drawbacks that are important for flippers to consider."

        "Investor Flexibility: LLCs make it simple to bring in partners or investors for specific flips, and allow for easy transfer of ownership shares.",
        "Potential Tax Benefits: Profits and losses from your flips can pass through to your personal taxes, potentially reducing self-employment tax exposure.",
        "Increased Privacy: Your name doesn’t appear on the public deed—only the LLC’s name does, offering some privacy from buyers, sellers, and contractors."
