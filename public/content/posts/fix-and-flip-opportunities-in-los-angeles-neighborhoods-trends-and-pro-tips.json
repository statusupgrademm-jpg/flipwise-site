        "Downtown LA: Lower-than-average purchase prices ($642,500 median) and high rental rates ($4,078 median for a 2-bed), with many older buildings ideal for value-add renovations.",
        "North Hollywood (NoHo): Strong demand from entertainment professionals, rising rents (up 19% YoY), and a median home price of $851,500 make it a solid flip market.",
        "Silver Lake: High appreciation (26.1% YoY) and trendy appeal. Median home price is $1,665,000, but buyers pay a premium for stylish, updated properties.",
        "Mid-City: Central location, solid appreciation (18.3% YoY), and high rents. Median price $1,425,000. Great for multi-family flips and rentals.",
        "South Los Angeles: Affordable entry point ($752,500 median), rapid appreciation (29.2% YoY), and growing demand due to gentrification. Ideal for budget-friendly flips and multi-family conversions."

        "Clarify your flip goals: Are you targeting quick resales or long-term holds? Choose neighborhoods and property types accordingly.",
        "Add value: Focus on cosmetic upgrades, layout improvements, or adding ADUs (Accessory Dwelling Units) to boost both resale value and rental income potential.",
        "Pursue off-market deals: Look for distressed properties, absentee owners, or homes with deferred maintenance for the best flip margins.",
        "Monitor foreclosures: Bank-owned properties and auctions can offer below-market deals, but require careful due diligence.",
        "Don’t over-improve: Use cost-effective materials and finishes that appeal to local buyers and renters—avoid over-customizing for the neighborhood.",
        "Know local laws: Check LA’s renovation, rental, and short-term rental ordinances before you buy or flip.",
        "Consider syndication: If LA’s high prices are a barrier, pool resources with partners or join a syndicate to access larger deals."
