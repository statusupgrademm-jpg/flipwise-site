        "Income Approach: Used less often in flipping, but helpful if you’re considering holding as a rental. Calculate the value based on rental income and local cap rates.",
        "Cost Approach: Estimate what it would cost to rebuild the property, then subtract depreciation. Useful for unique properties or new construction flips."

        "Calculate the price per square foot for each comp, average them, and multiply by your property’s square footage to estimate value."
