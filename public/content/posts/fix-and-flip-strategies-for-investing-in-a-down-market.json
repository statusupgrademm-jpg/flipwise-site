      "text": "When the market slows down, many investors get nervous, but for fix-and-flip professionals, this is the time to find properties at a discount. Market cycles are normal, and downturns mean less competition and more motivated sellers. Buying low during these times allows you to maximize your profit when the market rebounds."

        "Minimize renovation risk: Stick to cosmetic updates and avoid major structural projects that can eat into profits.",
        "Rebalance your portfolio: If you have multiple projects, consider shifting focus to lower-cost flips or faster turnaround properties.",
        "Keep investing: Don’t stop buying just because the market is down—historically, those who buy during downturns see higher returns when the market recovers.",
        "Explore partnerships: Team up with other investors to share risk and pool resources for larger projects.",
        "Leverage alternative financing: Consider hard money loans or real estate crowdfunding to access capital when traditional lenders tighten up.",
        "Monitor local market trends: Pay close attention to neighborhoods showing signs of recovery or growth for your next flip."
