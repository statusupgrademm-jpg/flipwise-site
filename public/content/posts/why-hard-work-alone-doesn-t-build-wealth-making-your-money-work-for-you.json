The number of hours you can work is limited, and most jobs, even those with high hourly rates, often do not provide enough surplus after expenses and taxes to accumulate significant wealth."

        "Invest in rental properties: Rental real estate offers passive income, potential appreciation, and tax advantages. Turn-key properties often require less active management once tenants are in place, though the initial investment can be substantial.",
        "Participate in real estate syndications: If purchasing property outright isn’t feasible, joining a syndication allows you to pool funds with other investors for professionally managed projects. This can include fix-and-flip opportunities, multi-family developments, or long-term rentals, and typically requires little industry experience."
